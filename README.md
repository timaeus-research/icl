Singular Learning Theory for In-Context Learning
================================================

Understand the emergence/development of in-context learning in transformers
trained on in-context linear regression tasks.

The main focus is on the phase transitions ehibited in the
[**task diversity paper**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15063).

Project admin
-------------

For discussion and managing the project:

* Project discussion and meetings take place on the DevInterp Discord server.
  (some prior discussion in the group chat).
* A GitHub project tracks TODO items
  ([here](https://github.com/orgs/timaeus-research/projects/2/views/3))
* There are two google docs associated to the project:
  * Jesse is maintaining meeting notes
    ([here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yQmCNlIql18TYX--9CAgmI1kxcnVe1kpymadifK6wy4/edit))
  * Dan's original note appears to have been abandoned:
    ([here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S4kBVFhlQBVRrdMrhRZz_4BS5N2_ef9HA051rKM7nCE/edit))

For code and experiments:

* This GitHub repository stores the experiment code, issues, etc.
  (you are here)
* W&B is used to track metrics from training runs
  ([here](https://wandb.ai/devinterp/icl))
* AWS is used to store snapshots:
  (unsure where to link...)

For writing up:

* Regrettably we are using overleaf to draft a preprint
  ([here](https://www.overleaf.com/project/64ee6fc2297aa3dfc799310a))

Tentative target venues:

* AISTATS 2024 ([here](http://aistats.org/aistats2024/)).
  Key dates (subject to change? there is no cfp yet?):
  * Abstract deadline:               6 October 2023 (Anywhere on Earth)
  * Paper submission deadline:      13 October 2023 (Anywhere on Earth)
  * Paper decision notifications:   19 January 2024
  * Conference dates:                2 May - 4 May 2024 (Valencia ðŸ’ª)
* Present preliminary results at DevInterp confernece in November
  (no proceedings?)


Set-up environment for running experiments
------------------------------------------

Clone this repository locally:

```
git clone git@github.com:timaeus-research/icl.git
```

Install standard dependencies (`torch`, `tqdm`, wrappers for AWS and W&B,
etc.):

```
# inside icl repository
pip install --editable .
```

The `devinterp` library is another dependency, but it's not yet available
through pip.
For now, install this library from source using `pip install --editable`
(where `--editable` means any changes to the library will not require
reinstallation):

* IF you already have the repository on your machine, run:
  ```
  pip install --editable /path/to/devinterp_repository
  ```

* IF you do not already have the repository, step outside the icl repository
  and run:
  ```
  # OUTSIDE icl repository
  git clone git@github.com:timaeus-research/devinterp.git
  pip install --editable devinterp
  ```
  Cloning devinterp *inside* the icl repository is not ideal as (1) you will
  have to deal with nested git repositories and (2) you will have to deal
  with the name conflict between the repository/folder named `devinterp` and
  the pip-installed library `devinterp`.

* IF you already have cloned the devinterp library and installed with
  `pip install --editable`, but now you want to update to the latest source,
  go into the devinterp repository on your machine and run:
  ```
  git pull
  ```
  The changes to the source should be reflected next time you
  `import devinterp`.

To run code that reads or writes snapshots to AWS you will need your AWS API
keys in a local environment variable. Follow these steps:

1. Log in to your AWS account and go to the
   [security credentials page](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home#/security_credentials).
2. Copy your AWS secret access key and AWS access key ID.
3. Store them in a .env file in the project like so
   ```
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
   ```
   (TODO: figure out format and filename)
4. DO NOT check this file into git
   (TODO: .gitignore it)

Sorry the instructions aren't clearer---I'm still stuck at step 1 because of
some issue with my AWS account.

To run experiments with W&B logging you will need your associated API key
stored in your `.netrc`. Follow these steps:

1. Log in to your wandb account through the browser and copy your API
   key from [https://wandb.ai/authorize](https://wandb.ai/authorize).
2. Install wandb (`pip install -r requirements.txt` as above, or just
   `pip install wandb`)
3. Run the command `wandb login` (or `python -m wandb login`) and then
   paste your API key from step (2) when prompted.
4. This will create a file in your home directory called `.netrc`.
   Keep that file safe.

Configuring and running experiments
-----------------------------------

Configure and run a single experiment locally:

* TODO.

Configure and run a single experiment on Spartan:

* TODO.

Configure and run a sweep:

* TODO: Sweeps are defined using YAML etc.


Developer notes
---------------

Some of the model and baselines implementations have unit tests:

* Install additional testing dependencies `pip install pytest torch_testing`.
* Add tests in the `tests` directory (name the script `test_*.py`).
* Run the tests with the command `pytest`.


Work in this repository initially started in the devinterp repo. There may be
some atefacts such as commit messages referencing unrelated files and
projects.
Furthermore, for posterity, there is some discussion around metrics in
[this PR](https://github.com/timaeus-research/devinterp/pull/2).
